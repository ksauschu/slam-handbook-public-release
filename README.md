# SLAM Handbook Public Release

Together with a large number of experts in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) we are preparing the **SLAM Handbook** to be published by Cambridge University Press. This book will cover the theoretical background of SLAM, its applications, and its future as spatial AI. We expect this handbook will be a good guideline for those working in this field. 

Starting from the release of Part 1 in November 2024, Part 2 in March 2025, and Part 3 in May 2025, we incrementally release the book to accommodate feedback from the public. Please use this repository's **issue** and **discussion** board to report any issues or ideas regarding this book.
